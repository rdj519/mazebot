mazebot
fundamental classes:  - bot, maze, simulator, timertask (maybe), driver

fundamental classes:

- bot class (can only change its state and direction, moving will be simulated in the simulator class)
- maze class (mostly updates the visual representation of maze, and checks whether a space coordinate is walled)
- simulator class (this is where the search algorithm will be implemented, it will be easier to access the bot and maze class from here and show the simulation)
- driver
